# KamsGoofyGameHosting

I use this to host games for my games website you can use the files on here if you want but I wouldn't suggest it
I'm just gonna host the stuff for fnf and flash games

Here's the website https://probablykam.github.io/KamsGoofyGameHosting/ (if you want to actually link the files you have to add /(file name and ending)
